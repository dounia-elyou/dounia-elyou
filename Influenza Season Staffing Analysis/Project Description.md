# Influenza Season Staffing Forecast

## ðŸ“˜ Project Introduction  
This project supports a U.S.-based medical staffing agency in preparing for the annual influenza season. Hospitals and clinics often experience surges in patient volume during flu seasonâ€”particularly among vulnerable populations such as older adults. This project uses historical mortality and population data to help the agency forecast staffing needs by state and month. The analysis is grounded in ethical data practices and statistical methods to deliver actionable insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives  
The project aims to address the following questions:
- When should temporary medical staff be deployed across U.S. states?
- Which age groups are most at risk of influenza-related mortality?
- How can geographical and demographic trends guide staffing allocation?

## ðŸ“Š Key Deliverables  
**Data Cleaning & Integration**  
- Merged influenza mortality data (2009â€“2017) with population statistics by state, age, and gender.  
- Cleaned data for consistency, timeliness, and completeness.  

**Descriptive & Inferential Analysis**  
- Conducted exploratory analysis on age-specific death rates.  
- Found a strong correlation (0.95) between the population aged 65+ and influenza mortality.  
- Performed hypothesis testing to confirm that older adults (65+) face significantly higher mortality rates (t-statistic = 19, p-value = 0.00).  

**Visualisations**  
- Developed static and interactive charts in Tableau, including bar charts, heatmaps, and time-series graphs.  
- Created a Tableau storyboard to communicate spatial and temporal mortality trends.

**Staffing Forecast**  
- Identified peak mortality periods by state and age group.  
- Proposed staffing timelines to match hospital surge needs during the winter months.

## ðŸ“Œ Hypotheses Explored  
1. **Main Hypothesis**: Older adults (65+) have significantly higher mortality from influenza than younger age groups. âœ… Supported  
2. States with higher population density will have higher flu-related deaths.  
3. Higher child vaccination rates correlate with fewer flu-positive tests.  
4. Colder states experience more flu cases during winter months.  
5. Mortality from influenza increases during winter, raising staffing needs.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies  
- **Data Tools**: Microsoft Excel, Tableau  
- **Statistical Tests**: Two-sample t-test (unequal variances), Correlation analysis  
- **Visualisation**: Tableau Desktop (charts, maps, storyboard)  
- **Data Sources**: CDC Influenza Mortality, U.S. Census Population Estimates

This project demonstrates my ability to clean and integrate real-world health data, conduct statistical analysis, and translate insights into clear, ethical recommendations that support data-informed decision-making in the healthcare sector.
