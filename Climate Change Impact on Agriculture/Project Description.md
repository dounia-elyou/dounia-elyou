# Climate Change Impact on Agriculture â€“ Project Overview

## Project Introduction

This project explores the impact of climate variations (temperature, precipitation, and COâ‚‚ emissions) on crop productivity across different regions. Using simulated agricultural data, the analysis investigates how these climate factors influence food production and the broader implications for food security and sustainability.

## Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to assess the relationship between climate factors and crop yield. Specifically, this includes:

- Examining the impact of climate variables (temperature, precipitation, COâ‚‚ emissions) on agricultural productivity.
- Identifying regional patterns in crop yield and economic impact.
- Confirming the relationship between crop yield and economic impact using predictive modelling.

## Key Deliverables

- **Data Exploration & Analysis**: Analysing trends and correlations between temperature, precipitation, COâ‚‚ emissions, and crop yields.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Using predictive modelling to confirm the relationship between crop yield and economic impact.
- **Visualisations**: Creating an interactive dashboard to confirm the hypothesis that crop yield is a significant predictor of economic impact under varying climate scenarios.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Providing actionable recommendations to improve climate resilience in agriculture.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:

- [Climate Change Impact on Agriculture â€“ Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/climate-change-impact-on-agriculture?resource=download)

## Technical Skills & Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I developed expertise in:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Standardising data, handling missing values, and optimising data types.
- **Statistical Analysis & Predictive Modelling**: Applying regression analysis and time series forecasting to confirm the relationship between crop yield and economic impact.
- **Data Visualisation**: Creating meaningful visualisations to communicate complex data.
- **Climate Impact Analysis**: Understanding and analysing the effects of climate change on agriculture using real-world data.

## Conclusion

This project not only demonstrates my analytical and predictive modelling skills but also showcases my ability to address real-world issues related to sustainability and climate change through data-driven insights.
