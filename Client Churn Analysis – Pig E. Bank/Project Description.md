# Client Churn Analysis – Pig E. Bank  

## 📘 Project Introduction  
Pig E. Bank, a global financial institution, set out to reduce customer churn by understanding the key drivers behind client departures. As part of the *Data Ethics & Applied Analytics* achievement, this project applies ethical data handling and analytical methods to uncover insights into client behaviour, supporting strategies to improve retention, growth, and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
Using Microsoft Excel, the project aims to explore client churn trends and address key business questions:

- Which customer demographics are most likely to leave the bank?  
- What behavioural patterns (e.g., inactivity, product usage) are predictive of churn?  
- How does the use of financial products and services affect client retention?

## 📊 Key Deliverables
